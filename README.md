# Introduction: Understanding Disease Dynamics with the SEIR Model

In this project, we delve into the dynamics of infectious disease transmission and the effectiveness of control strategies using the SEIR model. Specifically, we explore how household size influences disease dynamics and the impact of control approaches such as increased diagnostic rates, case isolation, and mass immunization.

The SEIR model assumes no births, deaths, or population movements and considers transmission both within and across households through a stochastic mechanism. Parameters for transmission are set to 1.0 within homes and 0.25 between households.

Our study reveals that household size significantly affects disease spread, altering transmission rates within and between homes even without control measures in place. By disabling control measures, we examine the direct impact of household size on disease dynamics, finding that larger households correlate with a higher average number of infected individuals.

Additionally, we analyze the effects of control methods like mass vaccination programs, quarantines, and mortality due to infection and vaccination. By assessing various household sizes, transmission rates, and symptom development probabilities, we determine that balancing mortality costs between infection and vaccination is the optimal strategy for reducing fatalities. 

In conclusion, this study underscores the importance of mathematical modeling in understanding infectious disease transmission dynamics and evaluating control strategies. The SEIR model serves as a valuable tool for exploring control options and parameters, providing insights that can inform decision-making in public health and guide the development of effective control techniques.
